# Syncthing in Docker

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/meonkeys/syncthing.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/meonkeys/syncthing/)

Yet another [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) Docker container/image.

See [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/meonkeys/docker-syncthing/blob/master/Dockerfile) and [example `run.sh` script](https://github.com/meonkeys/docker-syncthing/blob/master/run.sh) for usage.

For inotify support simply run [syncthing-inotify](https://hub.docker.com/r/meonkeys/syncthing-inotify/) in a container next to your `syncthing` container. The rest is done for you.

Forked from <https://github.com/tianon/dockerfiles/>.
